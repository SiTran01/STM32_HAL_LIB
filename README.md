# STM32_HAL_LIB
Personal STM32 HAL library project for learning embedded C and peripheral programming.

# STM32_HAL_LIB

ðŸŒ± This is a personal STM32 HAL library that Iâ€™m writing as part of my learning process in embedded programming.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice writing C code with a clear and modular structure
- Gain hands-on experience working with STM32 peripherals using the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

## ðŸ›  Tools

- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL drivers
- Language: C

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This project is for learning purposes, so the code may not be perfect
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
